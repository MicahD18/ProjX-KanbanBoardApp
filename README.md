# ProjX

A web application built using React where you create your own kanban boards. Add containers to your board to keep track of your tasks. Create tasks and drag & drop them anywhere on your board.

## What I Learned

1. Redux (for state management)

Handles:
  - boards data
  - modals
  - sidebar

2. Implementing 'Drag & Drop' functionality using dnd-kit library

3. CRUD operations for:
  - boards
  - columns
  - tasks

4. Utilizing localStorage (for data integrity) 

## Installation

##### 1. 'npm install' to install the dependencies
##### 2. 'npm run dev' to run local dev server
