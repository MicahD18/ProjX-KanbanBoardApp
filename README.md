# ProjX

A web application I built using React where you create your own kanban boards. Add containers to your board to keep track of your tasks. Create tasks and drag & drop them anywhere on your board.

## Installation

##### 1. 'npm install' to install the dependencies
##### 2. 'npm run dev' to run local dev server

## What I Learned

#### 1. Redux (for global state management)

Handles:
  - boards data
  - modals
  - sidebar

#### 2. Implemented a 'Drag & Drop' algorithm using the dnd-kit library

#### 3. CRUD operations for:
  - boards
  - columns
  - tasks

#### 4. Utilizing localStorage (for data integrity)

#### 5. Handling modals and user input
